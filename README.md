# MixtureMetrics
This project calculates additive scheme for mixture descriptors for multi-component materials. The algorithm takes input from two .csv files, first one containing individual descriptors of each component and the second one containing the mole fraction values of each component of each mixtures.
The main function "mixture_descriptors_to_csv" gets three arguments 1- descriptors file path 2- mole fraction file path and 3- output directory (to store the 12 .csv output files)
This code computes 12 different mixture descriptors based on 12 different metrics and returns 12 .csv files for each one. 
To install the package, begin by downloading the ZIP file from the GitHub repository and extracting its contents. Then, navigate to the extracted directory using the command line interface. Once in the directory containing the package files, install it using "pip install .". After successful installation, you can import and utilize the package's functions in your Python code using " from MixtureMetrics import mixture_descriptors_to_csv‚Äù
